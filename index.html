			<h2>In the process of it all, I found you</h2>
			<p>Much like <em>charqui</em>, my research is tough like dry meat;

				preparation.<br> My heritage that is fermenting through generations, obtaining a cross
				of (bacterial) cultures, molding a new strain packed with ancient
				knowledge. One that can’t be sure where its origin lies, bubbling until
				it is ready to reveal its new flavor. A cloudy brine that conserves the
				herbs and spices taken from the old trade routes. Mason jars of memories
				conserved in the storage in my head, ready to be opened through the firm
				rotation of my hand and with curiosity of biting into its firm
				consistency. Within the practices of drying, fermenting and pickling
				there is one thing that binds them. The main ingredient salt, and I am
				here to document it. I will look into; How salt, through its
				conservational qualities in food preparation can be used to connect and

			<h2>The common, precious Salt</h2>
			<p>There is art in the movements of cooking. The elegance of friction
				between thumb, index, and middle finger evenly and so precise spreading
				translucent grains over a bubbling dish.<br>The petite kitchens in the Netherlands remind me so often of
				a cage,
				with no means of letting the body and soul expand. Food is simply a
				means to survive; a task carried on for the purpose of consumption and
				not to be seen as practice of reconnecting with one’s body. Reconnection
				with one’s body can be considered an art of healing. There is movement
				and companionship in cooking. Small kitchens are nothing but a hindrance
				to what is supposed to be a place in which people come together and
				reconnect. It excludes the experience of families and friends who come
				together through the process of food making.<br> Every culture carries an abundance of history.
				Entangled in their
				recipes, concealed within their dishes: ingredients, flavours, and
				preparations are particular to a place and time. And just as a memory,
				at risk to be forgotten. Like the story of salt.<br> My parents would regularly sit on my bedside in the
				evening before
				they would kiss me off to sleep and would tell me the stories they heard
				during their own childhood. One of my favourites stories, was the one my
				mother would tell me about the king and the salt.</p>
			<p><em>The story starts as many others. In a faraway kingdom with a king
					and his three beautiful daughters. The king bored and insecure one day,
					called his daughters to the throne to put them under a test. “How much
					do you love me?”, he asked them. The eldest daughter replied: “I love
					you as much as the treasures of gold you bring me from far away
					islands.”, satisfied with her answer he moved on to the middle child,
					which responded with an answer as satisfying as the first one: “I love
					you as much as the clearest crystal you gifted me from the deepest of
					all oceans”. Finally, he turned to his youngest daughter with the same
					question: “I love you as much as the salt we put on our food.” The
					answer of the youngest infuriated the king. “How can you say something
					such as this. Salt is cheap and has no worth!”, with these words he
					banished his youngest daughter from his kingdom.<br> Years passed by when suddenly the king received
					an invitation of
					the neighbouring kingdom to attend the wedding of the prince. The day of
					the wedding arrived which the king attended. After the ceremony, as the
					food started to arrive to the tables and the king longing to fill his
					empty stomach, took a bite out of the turkey served in front of him.
					“But this meat is tasteless! Completely bland!“, he called out. He hoped
					the next served dish would be better, but with each bite he took he was
					reminded of his act of injustice. Saddened with the memories of his
					banished daughter, he made his way to the prince and bride to thank them
					until he stood in front of them.<br>“I hope you learned your lesson father”, the beautiful bride,
					his
					daughter revealed herself in front of him. They made up and lived
					happily ever after.</em>
					
					<a href="#tooltip2" class="tooltip-ref" id="tooltipref2" role="tooltip-ref"><sup>2</sup></a>
				
					<span class="is-tooltip">
						The story was written by Italo Calvino, an Italian
						writer, who retold the story from ancient folktales which knew exactly
						the importance of salt. White gold, it was named in the past. Its value
						was so high that people would get paid in this digestible currency and
						it is the linguistic origin of the word ‘salary’.

			<p>Salt is the key element of conservation. Brine-pools found in nature
				kill any creature living in aerobic environments and when falling in to
				such a pool, its present state of being is conserved entirety. Human
				mummies found in the salt desert of Atacama have been preserved for
				centuries without any signs of decay. When enough salt is introduced in
				the food environment, the bacteria responsible for generating the “bad”
				mold becomes isolated and has almost no access to the living matter. In
				its place, the good bacteria, which are mostly resistant to salt, can
				continue to grow.</p>

			<h2>With one strip of Charqui from the Andes I vow not to forget you</h2>
			<p>A soft tingle calls me to a faraway land. A land which culture I’d
				love to call mine but fail to find the answers of belonging, which
				confuses me ever so often. I belong everywhere and nowhere. The
				chameleon who changes clothing, manners, tone of voice and movements to
				fit in. Behind the mask there is another and another and another.<br> The breeze of the arid
				environment, the warmth of the last sunrays
				that sets above the San Pedro de Atacama.<br>This lingering question creeps in again and brings me back
				to
				reality. I slap my hand down the wooden table. “My culture is whatever I
				used to cooked in the past, what I cook today and what I will cook
				tomorrow.” The flavours of distinct cultures that come to hug me like my
				did grandmother when I was a child. These flavours that carry and
				remember me throughout my life.<br>In my mind passes the bus I used to sit in. The hourlong ride we
				took, the little breaks in which strangers with huge plastic bags came
				on the vehicle to sell this salty delicacy. My strongest memory of
				Charqui resides in the stuffy bus full of voyagers like me. I don’t need
				to be reminded. Its dry floury rough texture which leaves a crumbly
				fatty layer on my fingertips. The biting but subtle scent of iron, but
				most of all, the saltiness that engulfs my mouth. A piece of meat that
				reminds me of Chile itself; a rough terrain you must chew through and
				rip apart to understand its complex layers and lost history hidden
				within this long strip of land.<br> History was made along the trade routes of salt. Through the
				discovery of its conservational qualities, salt became a necessity in
				trade and in the household long before the fridge. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a><br> The application of salt directly on the meat’s surface
				removes the
				water stored in the flesh, prolonging its conservational qualities. Once
				the water is removed, the flesh’s weight is reduced, which results in
				lighter transportation of the goods. The concentration of the flesh also
				enhances its flavor. The arid and cold environments in the Andes help
				significantly to reduce the growth of bad mold.</p>
			<p><em>Charqui</em> – which derives from Quechua language and translates
				to thin and dry – is nothing else than what the rest of the world knows
				as beef jerky. Quechua, which was one of the largest indigenous empires
				in Latin America during the pre-Columbian era

				conjunction with the loss of
				knowledge of this ancient language comes the loss of the knowledge to
				the preparation of <em>charqui</em>. There remain only a few families
				that know the secret of its manufacture.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
				<em>Charqui</em> was and is still handcrafted on different altitudes
				through the Andean area in Chile.
			</p>
			<p>A word comes to my mind which can only be expressed in its own native
				language, even if it is not my own; <em>Saudade.</em>
				
				<a href="#tooltip7" class="tooltip-ref" id="tooltipref7" role="tooltip-ref"><sup>7</sup></a>

				<span class="is-tooltip">
					Saudade in Portuguese is translated to an intense
						longing for someone or something. Unlike nostalgia one can feel
						“saudade” for something that might never have happened or existed
				</span>
				
				It is the <em>Charqui</em> that takes me back home. I express the feeling
				of saudade because across the continent parts of my native ingredients
				simply do not exist. How can I reconnect to my roots without having any
				access to the ingredients nor being near the environment of my
				ancestry?</p>

			<h2>One unknown Jar of Capers I forgot in my Cabinet</h2>
			<p>I am not sure what to cook today. It has been a long and cold day.
				The little forest I pass by when going home is dull from the fog created
				by the rigid environment. The persistent cold has taken the shine from
				the tree leaves and colors them dark green. I find the same color upon
				opening the door to my cabinet. Sitting there, in a small jar that once
				contained orange or fig jam from the <em>nonna</em> next door, now holds
				little buds covered in coarse sea salt. This little jar, before filled
				with sadness for slowly losing the sweet marmalade smell which
				previously coated its inner walls, now glows with the enthusiasm of a
				snow globe.<br>The buds of the Capparis spinosa were taken before they were allowed
				to bloom into beautiful pink petals. I taste the process, the harsh sun
				under which these sprouts bloom, the red dirt covered hands that pick
				each bud so carefully and selectively while a drop of sweat rolls down
				their tanned neck, tickling them.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Innocence and pureness
				surround these capers hiding under salt. The hands that so carefully
				moved them from their harvest until the time of their use in the
				kitchen. I can’t force myself to use a spoon to take them out of the jar
				nor use any other tool to wash them under water other than my own gentle
				hands.<br>Stored in these bulb looking jars with the glass, foggy from the
				coarse salt, I have my own little snow-globe of Sicilian culture. The
				origin of these mason jars is unknown, constantly circulating in the
				hands of women caretakers around me creating imprints on the glass
				handed to me, the same ones that shaped my being of who I am today.</p>
			<p>The salt washes over me, not only preserving my developing nature but
				also giving me the flavor of time. In my own way, I will find my own
				taste.</p>

			<h2>A taste of salty Caramel and four Countries later</h2>
			<p>Growing up within a half Italian household, I can safely declare we
				are a proud folk when it comes to our food. Judgment befalls those who
				change the context of the recipe. We like to believe that the original
				is best. The best comes, of course from our mothers. Originality is
				contested even between Italian people. Only through the change of
				countries and the unavailability of quality products, has made me raise
				my doubt of this engraved belief. There is a need to deviate from the
				strict origins of cuisines.<br>I spoke with Asli Hatipoğlu, an artist with Turkish-Thai roots and
				master of fermentation based in Brussels. Through her I came to
				understand that the West, too tied to its needs of introducing
				originality into worldly cuisines forgets one important aspect: the
				reason of the arrival of international cuisines was for people to be
				able to reconnect to their roots and their origins. Their adaptation
				through ingredients becomes an adaptation and interpretation of their
				lost homes within their new and foreign environments. Over those five
				hours, I came to see Asli as a caring person. She knows and understands
				the value of communication and creating safe environments. Environments
				in which cooking becomes a learning experience through the ingredients
				in front of us.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a><br>The need to share became even clearer on a lecture I joined
				with Moon
				Sung Hee, who visited from Korea the city of Ghent for the event
				Sonmat.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Back in
				Korea, Moon’s collective
				hosts workshops on what I grasped as ‘innocent cooking’.<br>It was through her story and a simple piece
				of candy, <em>ganjang
					caramel</em> translated as soy sauce caramel that has presented to me
				the possibilities of redefining culture through food.<br>The importance of this candy lies in its
				production.
				<br>Soy sauce replaces the typical salt grains Westerners place on the
				table. Within this candy it is important to understand the quality of
				the soy sauce. Traditionally soy sauce is made through fermentation.
				Cheaper variants are often not fermented which results in a faster
				production but an end product lacking aroma and flavor.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
				The magical collaboration began when Moon reconnected with her friend, a
				woman who travelled from Korea to Ghent to learn the practice of the
				typical caramel candy production in Belgium. The outcome of the reunion
				resulted in the first and probably last candy of this sort I will ever
				come across: a caramel candy made with Moon’s 15-year-old fermented soy
				sauce.
			</p>
			<p>Moon reclaims her tradition by culturally reviving son-mat.

				<a href="#tooltip12" class="tooltip-ref" id="tooltipref12" role="tooltip-ref"><sup>12</sup></a>

				<span class="is-tooltip">
					<em>Son-mat</em> (hand taste) comes from the Korean
					belief that the energy of one’s body touching the food influences its

			<h2>Is it still Witchcraft when Salt leaves the Sea and the Olive starts bleeding?</h2>
			<p>In Italian culture, as in most countries, salt is seen as a sacred
				good. As shown in the story written by Italo Calvino, salt carries a
				deeper meaning that considers not only its use in the kitchen but also
				in subcultural rituals and traditions.<br>One such ritual was once performed on my mother. The
				<em>Malocchio</em> ritual consists of determining whether someone
				attached an evil eye on a person and in breaking any such spell.<br>Breaking the spell will remove any
				physical disturbances and bad luck
				that the evil eye created.<br>In the ritual, the person sits in front of a plate filled with water,
				at least from what I experienced that gloomy afternoon, the spell
				performer then dips their fingers in olive oil and holds it above the
				plate of water. If the fallen drops remain one, then no such spell was
				cast. If the drops fall and split into many small droplets it means
				someone gave you the <em>malocchio.</em><br>
				To break such spell, the following words need to be spoken while
				dropping salt in four points of the plate forming a transparent cross:
				“Father, Son and the Holy Spirit”. The performer then touches with their
				oil covered fingertips the salt next to them. They touch upon the
				victim’s forehead and speaking following lines:
			</p>
			<p><em>Occhio malocchio pigghiata d<span dir="rtl">’</span>occhio<br />
					nesce u malocchio e trase u bonocchio<br />
					Sinni va pa so via<br />
					cu Gesù, Giuseppe e Maria.</em></p>
			<p>When finished with this ritual it is crucial to get rid of the water.
				It is in everyone’s best interest to throw it as far as possible from
				home, to not have the <em>malocchio</em> finding its way back to you. To
				make sure the spell is properly broken one recites:</p>
			<p><em>Acqua e sale pi li mari<br />
					acqua e sale pi cu ni vole male</em><a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
					role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

					<img class="img7" src="/assets/images/7.png" alt="rituale">

			<p>The artist Patricia Kaersenhout is another notable example of using
				salt as a form of ritual. For the exhibition Manifesta 12 in Palermo,
				the artist had placed a mountain of 8,000 kilograms of salt in the
				middle of a room, then young refugees sang 19th century slave songs
				while a <em>Winti</em> Priest
				<a href="#tooltip14" class="tooltip-ref" id="tooltipref14" role="tooltip-ref"><sup>14</sup></a>

				<span class="is-tooltip">
					Afro-Surinamese priest. The religion Winti originated
					in Suriname.
				</span>
			
					blessed the salt.
				Spectators could then carry the salt with them and dissolve it in water
				at home. Her comment towards the artwork: <em>“The sea salt refers to
					the salt which enslaved people refrained from eating so they could fly
					back to Africa. But it also stands symbol for mental and physical
					liberation. It refers to slaves crossing the salt water of the Atlantic
					Ocean on their way to plantations. It<span dir="rtl">’</span>s the salt
					of all the tears shed during slavery and colonialism.”</em><a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
					id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a><br>
				Patricia Kaersenhout uses salt as a remedy for healing to release the
				pain of the past.</p>
			<p>Through the previous examples given, salt resurfaces not only as an
				ingredient on the table but is also used in mourning, in removing the
				bad, and celebrating the small moments in life. Whether one does so
				intentionally or unintentionally, it is shown how these small grains
				play a big role in across different cultures and generations.</p>

			<p>The last one was made by my uncle in Sicily. Little honey-colored
				rocks shimmering in sugar like crystals. Sugar and salt. Sweet and
				salty. Putting these words together makes me think indeed of my uncle,
				although I felt I never had a strong connection with him. Yet he was one
				out of all three siblings who made me laugh the most. I look back
				smiling at an adult man who would ram his head in my grandmother’s

				shedding tears of laughter with the rest of my family.<br>
				In my youth my uncle took me fishing once. He put me in his little

				the Strait of Messina – where the sea parts Messina from the mainland,
				making the western tip of Calabria the closest to our island.<br>
				How many legends my <em>nonna</em> told me of the monsters that lured
				so close by. One of the most famous ones was Odysseus journey home to
				Ithaca. In which he encounters the cyclops <em>Polyphemus</em> and upon
				his escape other monsters awaited. <em>Scylla</em>, a beautiful nymph
				that was turned into a monster and ate sailors on the Calabrian side,
				hiding in a cave at the cliff. <em>Charybdis</em>, creating large
				whirlpools known to sink ships residing, or even being the Strait of
				Messina itself. The idiom between <em>Scylla</em> and <em>Charybdis</em>
				arose, to choose among two dangerous paths and mastering its escape.<br>
				I truly rose amongst gods and monsters.</p>
			<p>I sat there in silence while my uncle showed me how to tie worms,

			<p>The protagonist in Sicilian and Portuguese kitchen is the
				<em>baccalà</em> or <em>bacalhau</em>. The term is mostly used to
				describe white fish put under salt. The cod which was originally fished
				in Norway fished cod is now found in most coastal regions’ recipes
				across many different cultures. The fish did not spread only through
				commercial routes but also through its natural course of habitat.
				Certain families of the cod are also fished in the Mediterranean.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
					id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a><br>
				The rays of sun heating the ocean water by the beach, in distance the
				typical swordfish boats with its long mast. If I would describe the
				<em>charqui</em> as winter, then the cod cannot be anything other than
				summer. I may be wrong with the assumption as cod gets fished all year
				around, yet my mind cannot connect it to anything other but the
				<em>insalata di baccalà alla siciliana</em>.<br>
				A salad which is eaten very differently in comparison to others. One
				eats it with conscience. The fibrous consistency must be masticated with
				intent. No other thought is permitted to enter during this action. Like
				the cod itself knew: “<em>I am here at your mercy, and I will make you
					work for it.</em>” Through its tough flesh we are forced to notice and
				experience the depth of its flavor.<br>
				The utmost important thing when handling the <em>baccalà,</em> is to
				immerse the fish in water for up to three days before it gets cooked.
				The water gets replaced repeatedly. After the process of boiling the
				fish, it finds itself in a mixture of tomatoes, onions, potatoes, capers
				and other herbs. The cod taken from its native brine, to find itself in
				another, even more fragrant one.

			<h2>There once was a Child picking Apples and Lemons, until it found a salty Rock</h2>
			<p>My feet take the first step on the new land. A land I revisited in
				the past. You should know me. Your history runs partly through my veins,
				merged with the Sicilian proudness. I took a stone with me when I left
				you, back to my home I never really belonged to. I licked your bumps and
				nooks while my eyes squinted from the salinity. Feel the small sand
				grains that grind on my teeth when I swish you through my mouth. I
				ingested you. And yet, I cannot sound the way your natives speak. The
				other day, one of you came to my home to pick up a table my roommate
				sold. I did not recognize you until you answered the phone call. The
				little sing sang your children master. How close I felt in that moment
				and with excitement I engaged, but she did not recognize me as theirs.
				She thought I was Mexican.</p>
			<p>My father laughed as I told him about the encounter: “It is true,
				Chilean people don’t recognize you. Your accent is not the same, but it
				is the language we always communicated in. It is the language we talk in
				when we say <em>I love you.</em>”</p>
			<p>I am afraid of losing my language a bit more. It is a difficult task
				to upkeep a language over the years of not being able to revisit the
				homeland. It has been too long. But don’t forget, I am the salt that
				conserves the culture. All of them. I am the vessel of my land. My hands
				don’t forget the motions when I prepare my native dishes.</p>
